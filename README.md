Sophus started as a c++ implementaion of Lie Groups / Manifolds. It evolved to a
collection of types and functions commonly used or 2d and 3d geometric problems
especially in the domain of `robotics`, `computer vision` annd `graphics`.

- [Lie groups / Manifold](#lie-groups) such as `SO(2)` and
  `SO(3)` to present rotations in 2d and 3,
- [Other geometric conecpts](#other-geometric-concepts) such as unit vector, plane
  fitting and inverse depth points,
- [Image classes](#image-classes)
- [Sensor models](#sensor-models) such `camera models` (as pinhole, orthographic
  and lens distortion model) and `IMU models`.
- [Sympy](#sympy) representations of selected types - for
  instance o symbolically derive Jacobians and autogenerate c++ code.
- [Serialization](#serialization) using proto (and soon json).

## üåêLie groups

### tldr: rotations, translations and scaling in 2d and 3d

`Lie groups` are generalizations of the Euclidean vector spaces R^N. A little
more formally, a Manifold which is also an [abstract group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory#Abstract_groups).

*Okay, and what is a Manifold?*

`Manifold` are generalizations of the Euclidean vector spaces R^N. In
particular, they behave locally like a Euclidean vector space, but globally
can have a very different structures. In particular there can be wrap-around.
The circle group SO(2) is the simplest example for such wrap around. Assume,
we have a dial pointing North. If you turn the dial 90 degree to the left, it
points West. If you turn it another 90 degrees it turns South. Now, if you turn
it again 90 degrees is points East. And you turn it left again for 90 degrees it
points North again. It wrapped around: `90 "+" 90 "+" 90 "+" 90 = 0`.

*Do I need to understand the concept of Manifold, Group Theory and Lie Groups
in order to use Sophus?*

Not at all! If you aim to solve geometric problems in 2d and 3d, it is best to
directly into concrete examples. By far the most commonly used Lie groups of
Sophus are the group of 3D rotations, also called Special Orthogonal Group,
short SO(3), as well as the group of rotation and translation in 3D, short
SE(3).

### 3d rotation example using the SO(3) type

```c++
  // The following demonstrates the group multiplication of rotation matrices

  // Create rotation matrices from rotations around the x and y and z axes:
  double const kPi = sophus::kPi<double>;
  sophus::So3F64 R1 = sophus::So3F64::rotX(kPi / 4);
  sophus::So3F64 R2 = sophus::So3F64::rotY(kPi / 6);
  sophus::So3F64 R3 = sophus::So3F64::rotZ(-kPi / 3);

  std::cout << "The rotation matrices are" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R1:\n" << R1.matrix() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R2:\n" << R2.matrix() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R3:\n" << R3.matrix() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Their product R1*R2*R3:\n"
            << (R1 * R2 * R3).matrix() << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::endl;

  // Rotation matrices can act on vectors
  Eigen::Vector3d x;
  x << 0.0, 0.0, 1.0;
  std::cout << "Rotation matrices can act on 3-vectors" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "x\n" << x << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R2*x\n" << R2 * x << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R1*(R2*x)\n" << R1 * (R2 * x) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "(R1*R2)*x\n" << (R1 * R2) * x << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::endl;

  // SO(3) are internally represented as unit quaternions.
  std::cout << "R1 in matrix form:\n" << R1.matrix() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "R1 in unit quaternion form:\n"
            << R1.unitQuaternion().coeffs() << std::endl;
  // Note that the order of coefficients of Eigen's quaternion class is
  // (imag0, imag1, imag2, real)
  std::cout << std::endl;
```

### 3d rotation + translation example using the SE(3) type

```c++
  // Example of create a rigid transformation from an SO(3) = 3D rotation and a
  // translation 3-vector:

  // Let use assume there is a camera in the world. First we describe its
  // orientation in the world reference frame.
  sophus::So3F64 world_from_camera_rotation =
      sophus::So3F64::rotX(sophus::kPi<double> / 4);
  // Then the position of the camera in the world.
  Eigen::Vector3d camera_in_world(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);

  // The pose (position and orientation) of the camera in the world is
  // constructed by its orientation ``world_from_camera_rotation`` as well as
  // its position ``camera_in_world``.
  sophus::Se3F64 world_anchored_camera_pose(
      world_from_camera_rotation, camera_in_world);

  // SE(3) naturally representation is a 4x4 matrix which can be accessed using
  // the .matrix() method:
  std::cout << "world_anchored_camera_pose:\n"
            << world_anchored_camera_pose.matrix() << std::endl;
```
